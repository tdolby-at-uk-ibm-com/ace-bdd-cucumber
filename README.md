# ace-bdd-cucumber
Example using ACE with Cucumber BDD

Building on the ideas (and initial feature) from https://cucumber.io/docs/guides/10-minute-tutorial/

## Usage 

Import into the ACE v12 toolkit, and run the test project. This should cause the 
cucumber BDD tests to run.

## Next steps

Use Maven instead of copying JARs around.

More scenarios - only the first one from the tutorial is implemented.
